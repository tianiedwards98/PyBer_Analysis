# PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview
The company V.Isualize has given the task to analyze the ride-sharing data of differnt cities by city type.
We have been asked to:
  - Provide a ride-shareing summmary dataframe by city type
  - Make a multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
  - Make a written report for the PyBer analysis


## Results
Deliverable 1:
Below is the results of the ride-sharing dataframe that was made in both the original calulations and in the formatted version to make it more understandable.

Deliverable 2:
Below is the file resampled dataframe for the fares according to the range of dates requested and the multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type

## Summary
The business recommendation that I would suggest is to decrease the amount of drivers in urban cities becasue the amount of drivers is almost double the total amount of rides there were. I would also say to increase the amount of drivers in rural areas becasue there is a lack of drivers where there are more rides that were taken as well as increasing the amount of drivers in surburban areas. I think this will allow more people to be able to get a ride to wherever their destinations maybe. and increase the amount of fares that the company will recieve.
